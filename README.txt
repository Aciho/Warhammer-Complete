This is the main readme for Warhammer-Complete.
To minimize merge conflicts, please create a changelog for any nations you modify, like my Slaanesh-changelog.txt. You'll have to add it in Git if you want it visible.
Also, if you use the Mod Editor, I've found it to be very slow with big files like WH-Complete's dm.
I'd very highly recommend dragging the relevant nation's stuff into a WIP file so you can edit in a timely manner.
It saved me a lot of time while I did it, and once I stuck things back in the main file a couple small changes took way too long.

That is all. Thanks to anyone who chooses to work on this project with me - let's make Warhammer great again!
