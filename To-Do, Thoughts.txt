Thoughts/Less Urgent:

Chaos:
Weapon standardization - fun stuff...

Dwarfs:
Dwarf Pretender, Brother of War, is too powerful (6 paths, 80 point cost), move to autocost minus something.
And their Ancient King pretender is too expensive.

TKs:
Overall limited pret choice
First King has Holy 4, probly to summon Immortals. Remove the Holy, give a summon allies and look at cost.

Tzeentch:
Pretty limited pretender choice, not terrible tho

Nurgle:
Same

Khorne:
Needs a ton of help, but pretender choice is shit and Lord of the End Times pretender should probably be revised

Morka:
Still has the Face of Gork

Dark Elves:
Witch King supposedly has a retinue but it isn't there

Skaven:
Pretty limited pret choice, though they have 3 custom ones.

VCs:
Pretty limited pret choice, no discounts for e.g. Vamp Queen
Cultist doesn't have a holy path, probly simple bug

Lizardmen:
Seems they have a very limited unit recruitment list...check and make sure nothing else should be there.
