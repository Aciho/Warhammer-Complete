Version .62
JoanSam's Slaanesh changes detailed in the relevant section of the .dm
Also removed the 'warhorse hoof' weapon and just replaced them with hooves. Only did 1 more damage anyway.
Courtesy of Zonk:
* All fixed cost pretenders switched to autocalc+0 and #cheapgod20. 
Many will need cost adjustements to account for abilities autocalc can't account for, such as #onebattlespell, but it's a start. Please report any unreasonable costs.
* Pretenders with MR < 18 and morale < 30 raised to that, except for Avatar of Horus who only got MR 14->16 (still fits his description, but less crippling)
* #makemonsterX -> #makemonstersX (so commanders meant to summon allies actually can)
* Skaven #cavenation 2 (will always start in caves in possible, previously it was 1 so 'can start in caves')
* Removed many obsolete or redundant pretenders, commands and comments, Orcs' Warpaint and Shadow King's Stone 'armor' (they did nothing, so waste of slots).
* Enabled pretenders for 
Wood Elves : Irminsul, Nature Dragon, Lord of the Wild, Volla of the Bountiful Forest, Idol of Beasts, Bitch Queen
Sylvania : Fountain of Blood, Vampire Queen, Demilich, Prince of Death, Statue of the Underworld, Master Lich, Dracolich, Raven of 
the Underworld, Linnormr, Bog Mummy, Frost Father, Bitch Queen, Ghost King
Tomb Kings : Master Lich, Demilich, Lich Queen, Prince of Death, Ghost King, Neter of the Underworld, Statue of the Underworld, Sphinx
* Light Wizard Lord: healer 20->2
